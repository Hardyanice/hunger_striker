Helps policymakers take proactive measures to prevent food crises.

Food Wastage Level Prediction:

Classifies the severity of food wastage levels into categories: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

Supports efficient food distribution and waste reduction strategies.

This tool empowers decision-makers with data-driven predictions, enabling them to make informed choices to combat hunger and food wastage effectively.
