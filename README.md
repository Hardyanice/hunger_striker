# Hunger Striker: A Food Security Prediction Tool

Hunger Striker is designed to assist policymakers, food suppliers, and researchers in addressing global food security challenges. By leveraging machine learning models trained on historical data, this tool provides valuable insights into two critical aspects of food security:

📉 Food Shortage Prediction
Estimates the likelihood of food shortages for a selected country and year.

Helps policymakers take proactive measures to prevent food crises.

🍽️ Food Wastage Level Prediction
Classifies food wastage severity into five levels: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

Supports efficient food distribution and waste reduction strategies.

This tool empowers decision-makers with data-driven predictions, enabling them to make informed choices to combat hunger and reduce food wastage effectively.

🔹 Note: The data used for both systems is synthetic, and predictions should not be interpreted as real-world forecasts.
